# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## What is this ?

This project is part of my **Curriculum Series**, the objective is to have a repository to prove my skills as a web developer.

My first encounter with javascript, here I created a simple rock-paper-scissor game vs the PC after I learned the basics of the language, conditionals statements, functions,loops etc.
Later on I revisited this project and added DOM methods to play the game outside the console.

The focus of this small app game is to get practice and understand how to logically put code together.

## Objective

- Get practice with my new javascript knowledge
- Get practice with DOM methods
- Try to create readable/understandable code
